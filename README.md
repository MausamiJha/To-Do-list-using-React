This project is a modern, responsive, and feature-packed To-Do List app built with React and Redux. It is designed to provide a smooth user experience, making task management simple and efficient.

Core Features

1. Add Tasks: Easily add tasks by typing them into a text field and pressing a button or hitting Enter.


2. View Tasks: See all your tasks neatly organized in a list.


3. Delete Tasks: Remove tasks instantly by clicking a delete button next to them.


4. Task Prioritization: Set priorities for your tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and see them organized accordingly.


5. Save Your Data: Your tasks and preferences are saved automatically using local storage or session storage, so they’re always there, even if you refresh or reopen the app.



Advanced Features

Handles asynchronous tasks (like fetching data from APIs) using Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.



3. API Integration:

Includes public API integration (e.g., a weather API) to enhance tasks with relevant information like current weather.
